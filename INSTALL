Installation Instructions
*************************

The ssdp program uses the autotools build system. This means the basic 
installation steps are:
./configure
make
sudo make install 

In some cases you may need to generate the autotools stuff (possibly 
after cloning the git repository). In this case you may want to run the 
autogen.sh script to set up everything. 

To remove the installation you can run:
sudo make uninstall

Optionally you may pass arguments to the configure script. The ssdp 
program has no package specific features you can anable or disable, 
just the standard autotools stuff. For example you can try to get 
faster code by trying things like:
./configure CFLAGS='-O3 -flto -march=native'

To change install prefixes and such have a look at the output of
./configure -h

Cheers
